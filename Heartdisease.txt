LinkedIn Project Description:
Title: Heart Failure Detection using Random Forest Classifier

Description:
In this project, we have developed a heart failure detection system using a Random Forest classifier. The system prompts users to answer specific questions related to various attributes, such as age, diabetes, smoking habits, high blood pressure, and platelet count, to predict the chances of heart failure.

During the project, we extensively studied the relationship between these attributes using a Heart Failure dataset. We performed feature engineering techniques to preprocess and extract relevant features from the dataset, enhancing the model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we employed a genetic algorithm to gain deeper insights into attribute relationships and optimize the model's performance.

The Random Forest classifier, known for its ability to handle complex relationships and achieve high accuracy, was chosen as the core machine learning algorithm. Through extensive training and validation using the Heart Failure dataset, our model achieved an exceptional accuracy of 98.6%. This remarkable accuracy ensures reliable and precise heart failure predictions.

To ensure the model's effectiveness, we incorporated the genetic algorithm to analyze the attributes further. By optimizing the model's hyperparameters and refining feature selection, we enhanced the model's performance and robustness. This integration of genetic algorithm techniques has further increased the accuracy and reliability of the heart failure detection system.

With an accuracy of 98.6%, our heart failure detection system provides individuals with personalized insights into their health condition. By leveraging the power of machine learning, feature engineering, and genetic algorithm techniques, we have created an accurate and user-friendly tool for predicting heart failure risks.
